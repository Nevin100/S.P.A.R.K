## 🧠 What’s the Problem?

Too many *bright minds*, too few *real opportunities*. SPARK steps in to tackle:

- 🕳️ **Skill gap** between academia and industry
- 🤝 Lack of **industry collaboration**
- 🧍‍♂️ Teaming troubles & **collaboration chaos**
- 💤 Missed hackathon goldmines & wasted sponsorship potential
- 🎓 Zero real-world project practice = 🚫 job-ready


---

## 💡 Enter: **SPARK**

SPARK isn’t just another platform. It’s the **ultimate dev ecosystem** 🔥 built to **level up students**, **connect industries**, and **supercharge hackathons**.

### 🛠️ Core Features

- 💼 **Industry Challenges**: Solve real-world tasks by actual companies.
- 🏛️ **Multi-Chapter Societies**: Cross-campus collabs just got easier.
- 🧪 **Internships & Open Source**: Learn by doing, not just watching.
- ⚙️ **AI Learning Paths**: Personalized, efficient & less overwhelming.
- 🤝 **Smart Sponsorships**: Companies meet hackathons → 💰+📈

## 🌟 Why SPARK Stands Out

- 👥 Community + Network = Supercharged peer learning
- 🔓 Open Source meets Real-World Projects
- 🔍 AI-Driven Learning → No more aimless tutorials
- 💬 Streamlined hackathon support for **both** students and sponsors
